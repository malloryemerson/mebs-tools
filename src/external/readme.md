# Changes to Winwheel

I updated Winwheel to suit this project in a few ways
1. I added basic typings to use it in a TypeScript project
2. I changed the code to allow for it to grow and not just shrink when in responsive mode
3. I added a parameter to let it know to share the space with a given number of other instances of the wheel.
4. Encapsulated the global state so more than one instance can be on a page at once.
